The main objectives of this project are:

1. To understand **cryptographic hashing** and its role in file integrity.  
2. To build a tool that computes and verifies **file hashes**.  
3. To demonstrate the use of **secure comparison (HMAC)** for digest verification.  
4. To provide an easy-to-use **Streamlit GUI** for practical implementation.
